Write simple kind of linked list.
The simplest kind of linked list is a singly linked list. Each element in the list contains data and a "next" field pointing to the next element in the list of elements.
This variant of linked lists is often used to represent sequences or push-down stacks (also called a LIFO stack; Last In, First Out).
As a first take, lets create a singly linked list to contain the range (1..10), and provide functions to reverse a linked list and convert to and from arrays.
When implementing this in a language with built-in linked lists, implement your own abstract data type.
