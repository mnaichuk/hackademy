Assignment name  : secret handshake
Expected files   : secrethandshake.go
Allowed functions: Handshake
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

Here's a couple of examples:
Given the input 3, the function would return the array ["wink", "double blink"] because 3 is 11 in binary.
Given the input 19, the function would return the array ["double blink", "wink"] because 19 is 10011 in binary. Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary) has caused the array to be reversed.
